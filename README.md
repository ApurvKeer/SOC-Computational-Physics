## Numerical Methods in Computational Physics

This involved implementation of some [numerical techniques](/Numerical%20Methods/), like the Euler, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods. This is illustrated in a [jupyter notebook](/Numerical%20Methods/Apurv_Numerical_Method.ipynb). There are also Fortran codes for these methods.

## Visualizing Poisson Equation Solutions

This was the first Mini-Project. The project involved solving the [Poisson equation](/Poisson%20Equation/) using the finite difference method. There is a [jupyter notebook](/Poisson%20Equation/Apurv_poisson_solutions.ipynb) and a [Fortran code](/Poisson%20Equation/poisson.f90) for this. The Fortran code produces a text file with pixel position and value.

## Visualizing Hydrogen atom wavefunctions

This was the second Mini-Project. The [project](/Hydrogen%20Atom/) involved numerically solving for eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Schrödinger equation for hydrogen atom. Similar content as mini-project one.

## Visualizing Time Evolution systems

This was the third Mini-Project. The project involves solving [time evolution](/Time%20Evolutions/) systems of equations using Runge-Kutta Algorithms.

## Raytracing in Curved Spacetime (Kerr Blackhole)

This is an open-ended project. The project involves visualizing a Kerr Blackhole by solving null geodesics around the spacetime. I have written the code in C++ and Fortran. The code prints an image in ppm P3 format. To save it, run

```console
$ ./a.out > image.ppm
```

This was the final result.

##BlackRay

I wrote a better raytracer. This one ray traces a Schwarzschild Black Hole. This was based on the previous work [Starless]{https://rantonels.github.io/starless/}, by Rantonels The geodesics equation was written in the form of a Binet equation given by,

$$ \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \vec{r} = -\frac{3}{2} h^2 \frac{\hat{r}}{r^5} $$

I have uv wrapped two images, one on the accretion disk and the other on the celestial sphere. This was the result.

Here you can see the accretion disk warped around the black hole and distortion in the celestial sphere in the form of an Einstein ring.
