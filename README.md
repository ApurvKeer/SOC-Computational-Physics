## Numerical Methods in Computational Physics

This involved implementation of some [numerical techniques](/Numerical%20Methods/), like the Euler, Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods. This is illustrated in a [jupyter notebook](/Numerical%20Methods/Apurv_Numerical_Method.ipynb).

## Visualizing Poisson Equation Solutions

This was the first Mini-Project. The project involved solving the Poisson equation using the finite difference method. The folder []
